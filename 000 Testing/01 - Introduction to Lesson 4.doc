1
00:00:00,412 --> 00:00:03,179
Finally, Sunshine has multiple activities

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:05,689
and we can move between them 
using InTense.

3
00:00:05,867 --> 00:00:07,900
We also know how to use Implicit InTense

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,839
to integrate activities from other apps.

5
00:00:09,892 --> 00:00:12,806
In this lesson, we'll dive into
just how the Android framework

6
00:00:12,806 --> 00:00:14,769
deals with your activities, in particular,

7
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:17,420
how the activity life cycle 
maybe different from what you're used to

8
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,355
from other platforms and environments.

9
00:00:19,382 --> 00:00:22,504
Don't worry, there's plenty of code 
for you to write.

10
00:00:22,504 --> 00:00:27,049
Yes. Plenty of code.
Lots and lots, and lots of code.

11
00:00:27,049 --> 00:00:30,507
We'll move Sunshine along,
implementing an underlying database

12
00:00:30,507 --> 00:00:32,770
and wrapping that in a content provider.

13
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,769
Everything you need to know 
to use persistent storage.

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,622
The goal is to ensure your app provides
a seamless, efficient experience

15
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:43,423
for your users, even when networks
may be slow or unavailable
